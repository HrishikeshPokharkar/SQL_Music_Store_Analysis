# SQL_Music_Store_Analysis

This is an SQL project designed to analyze online music store data.

This project aims to analyze a music playlist database. By examining the dataset with SQL, we can help the store understand its business growth by answering various types of questions.

The file Music_Store_Data_Analysis.sql contains three types of questions, categorized as Easy, Moderate, and Advanced. These questions are answered using SQL codes or queries. This SQL code includes techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTE), Recursive methods, and windowing functions. The project includes 11 datasets/tables under the music_database, which are interconnected with each other through common features/columns.
